# Dateabase

Dateabase redefines social connection and dating for Princeton undergraduates by shifting the focus from profiles to shared experiences. Instead of swiping through faces, users discover potential matches through activities they enjoyâ€”like coffee meetups, concerts, or study sessions. Through Princeton CAS authentication, a recommender system powered by interest-based matching, and a swipe-based mobile web interface, Dateabase ensures a secure, engaging, and personalized approach to connecting on campus.
